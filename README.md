# Awesome

> There are many "awesome-\*" repositories that list great projects.
> However, with so many options, it's challenging to find ones that are both well-maintained and of high quality.
> This project aims to curate a selection of "awesome" lists, ensuring that only the best and most reliable projects are featured.
